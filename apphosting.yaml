  #    The service account is typically "PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" or
  #    one specific to App Hosting. Check your IAM settings.

# This is often automatically detected by the Next.js buildpack for App Hosting.
# If your "start" script in package.json is "next start", this is usually not needed.
# However, being explicit can sometimes be helpful.
# binary: npm # or 'yarn' or 'pnpm' if you use those and configure it
