# Firebase App Hosting configuration

# Specifies the runtime and scaling configuration for your backend.
# Adjust these values based on your expected traffic and performance needs.
runConfig:
  minInstances: 0 # Minimum number of instances to keep running (0 for cost saving on low traffic)
  maxInstances: 100 # Maximum number of instances to scale up to
  concurrency: 80 # Number of concurrent requests an instance can handle
  cpu: 1 # CPU cores (0.08 to 8, 1 is a good default)
  memoryMiB: 512 # Memory in MiB (128 to 32768, 512 is a good default for Next.js)

# Environment variables available to your application at build and/or runtime.
# IMPORTANT: You MUST set the actual values for these variables in your
# App Hosting backend's environment configuration in the Google Cloud/Firebase console.
# The 'value' fields here are placeholders or defaults.
